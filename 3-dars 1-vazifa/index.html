   <p> I the book it said"<q><i>boa constricrors swalles their prey wole ,without chewing it.After that they are not able to move ,and they sleep through the six month that they need for digestion</i></q>
    <br><br>
    I pondered deeeply,than,over the adventures of the jungle.And after some work with a colored pencil I succeded in making my first draawing.My Drawing Number One.It looked some like this:
    <br>

    <br> <br>
    But they answered : <q><i>Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat? </i></q>
    <br><br>
    My drawing wa snot a picture of a hat.It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant .but since the grown-ups were not able to understand it , I made another driwing : I drew the inside of that the grown=ups could see it clearly . they always need to have things explained . My Drawing number two looked like this :
    <br>

    <br><br>
    The growns-ups' response ,this time ,was to lay aside my draawings of boa constrictors, whethor from the inside of the outside and deveto myself instead to geography,history,arithmetic,and grammer . that is why at the age of six i gave up what might have a magnificent carereer as a painter . I had been dishertened by the failure of my Drawig Number One and my Drawing Number Two,Grown-ups never understand anything by themthelves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining  thinks to them.
    <br><br>
    So than I chose another profession , and learned to piot airplanes . I have flown a little over allparts of the world, and it is true that geography has been very useful to me . At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona . if one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
    <br><br>
    In the course of this life I have had a great many counters with a great many people who have been concerned whith matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups , tis was a person of true understanidng . But whoever , would always say:
    <br><br>
    <q><i>that is a hat</i></q>   
    <br><br> 
     Than I would never talk person about boa constictor.  </p>
